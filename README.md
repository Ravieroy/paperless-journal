# My second Brain : Obsidian/Logseq
This repository contains the notes I have made using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), both of which are an excellent digital note-taking platform. While Obsidian is a proprietary software, Logseq is free and open-source (FOSS). The notes presented here is not exactly an alternative to [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish), which is a premium service, rather it allows the notes to be interconnected like in Obsidian/Logseq. 

This repository is a fork of [jobindj's](https://github.com/jobindj/obsidian-publish-mkdocs) GitHub repository.
