!!! note " What is this?"
	Hello, this is my collection of notes in Obsidian/Logseq linking style. There are mainly two kinds of notes here. One related to my academic career, which contains conceptual notes of basic and advanced physics. These notes were made while reading papers and would be useful to anyone from a physics background in general. Another set of notes are related to Linux, which contains general stuffs related to Linux. I made it to note down how certain things are done, how to get rid of certain errors, etc.

!!! note " How are notes arranged?"
	Following the modular approach of Linux, I have tried to make atomic notes, which means every note is small and mostly self-contained. One can start with any notes and then follow around by using the links in them. 

!!! note " How to use this?"
	This is to be read on the web format. The best way to read is to go to the homepage of each section, where a mildly curated list is present. Choose your desired topic and then follow the links or come back to the homepage. Linux related stuffs can be found in the folder `LinuxStuffs` and the mildly curated list can be seen at [[Linux Homepage]]. The notes I have been preparing for my studies and research can be found in `Academics` and a curated list can be found at [[Academic Notes Homepage]]. 

!!! note " Who am I?"
	I am research scholar at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, working on Condensed Matter Physics under Prof. Arghya Taraphder. You can find more about me and my work on my [GitHub page](https://ravieroy.github.io/). 

!!! note " Can I use/fork this?"
	I believe in sharing of knowledge without restriction, and hence all my projects are under MIT license. Don't know what that means? It's okay, anyone is free to do whatever they want with the content from my GitHub account. A detailed instruction to [[Forking this vault]] is also made. It will help you set up your own vault and even build it locally. 

!!! warning
	These notes are still being made and hence a lot of them would be empty for now.
