### Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME)

Tags: #chiral_magnetic_conductivity

- It is the phenomenon of electric charge separation along the external magnetic field that is induced by the chirality imbalance(nontrivial topology). The CME is a macroscopic quantum effect â€” it is a manifestation of the chiral anomaly creating a collective motion in Dirac sea. 
- CME refers to the appearance of additional charge current along the magnetic field when the two Weyl nodes have different chemical potential from each other.

MF is a crucial part in CME, as it breaks the rotational invariance and creates a preferred orientation for the spins of the fermions. 

### Equation for chiral magnetic current

$j_{ch}(\textbf{q},w) = \sigma_{ch}(\textbf{q},w) i \omega B(\textbf{q},w)$

where, $\sigma_{ch}(\textbf{q},w)$ is the complex chiral magnetic conductivity. The real and imaginary part of the quantity lead to currents, which are in and out of phase with the MF, respectively.
