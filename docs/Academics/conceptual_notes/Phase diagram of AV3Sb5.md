## Phase Diagram : $AV_3Sb_5$
The charge order([[CDW]]) and [[Superconductivity]] compete for the same electronic [[Density of states]] at the Fermi level ([[Fermi level]]), the superconducting transition temperature is typically enhanced as charge order(CO) is suppressed and evolves more gradually beyond the full suppression of CO. 

**Temperature dependent phase diagram** is studied through electrical transport measurements. 

### Resistivity Vs Temperature ($p = 0.1 \ \text{to} \ 2.3 \ \text{GPa}$)
The superconducting temperature increases from 0.9K to 3.1K at 0.4GPa with low-pressure CO becomes indiscernible above $p_{c1} = 0.5 GPa$. (*Remark: The sudden dip in resistivity gives the $T_c$*)

***There is an anomaly in the resistivity curve, and the strength of the anomaly reflects the size of the underlying electronic order parameter. In addition to the suppression of $T_{CO}$, the magnitude of the LPCO is also reduced under pressure.***

The derivative of the resistivity in the pressure range(0.1 to 2.3 GPa) shows a dip around the point of anomaly. As can be seen from the Phase diagram, the CO becomes indiscernible after 0.4 GPa. 

Charge order associated with $T_{CO}$ disappears rapidly upon pressure tuning.
