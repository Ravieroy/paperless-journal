##  Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE)
- The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), where charge carriers acquire a velocity transverse to an applied electric field
- The AHE signal can be distinguished from that of the ordinary Hall effect because it is not proportional to the magnitude of the applied magnetic field.
- Intrinsic AHE refers to the acquisition of a transverse momentum due to the electronic structure of a material endowing a large Berry curvature. 
- When the Nodal points are located near the Fermi level, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry opens an energy gap at these points, which leads to the generation of large Berry curvature and results in phenomena such as the AHE and the ANE (in magneto-thermoelectric measurements). 
- Extrinsic AHE refers to skew scattering, the scattering off of structural defects or magnetic impurities, which can also result in a transverse electron momentum.
