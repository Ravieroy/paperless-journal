# Time Reversal Symmetry 
---
The action of time reversal on a wave function then contains two parts: first take complex conjugation in a certain basis, then apply a linear transformation in this basis. That is, we can write.

$$
T = U K
$$
where, K denotes complex conjugation and U denotes some unitary transformation.
Then time reversal acts on the operators as, 

$$
TOT^{-1} = UKOKU^{\dagger} = UO^*U^{\dagger}
$$
That is, the action of time reversal on operators contains two parts: first take complex conjugation of the operator written in certain basis, then conjugate the operator by some unitary transformation in this basis.

## Time reversal breaking model
Let $\hat{H}(\mathbf{k})$ be the Hamiltonian considered which breaks time-reversal symmetry but preserves inversion symmetry, then we have the following condition to be satisfied, 

$$\hat{P}^\dagger\hat{H}(-k)\hat{P} = \hat{H}(k), \ \hat{T}^\dagger{H}(-k)\hat{T} \ne \hat{H}(k)$$
