## Fermi Pockets 
#Fermi_Surfaces
- **Fermi Pockets**: These are contours of Fermi energy in the Brillouin zone. Depending on the effective mass $m^*$ of quasi-particles, the Fermi pockets can be divided into electron pockets (if $m^*$ >0 ) and hole pockets (if $m^*$ <0).
- For weakly interacting Fermion systems, according to the Fermi liquid theory, all the low-energy physics happens around the Fermi surface. So by looking at the **shape and position of the Fermi pockets** in the Brillouin zone, we can determine many important physical properties of the Fermi liquid system.
