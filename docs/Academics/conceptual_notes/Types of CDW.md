# Types of CDW
If the new unit cell after [[CDW]] formation is an integer times larger than the original, then it is commensurate. Otherwise, it is incommensurate.

A CDW is commensurate if and only if the wave vector describing the CDW is a rational number times one of the vectors which make up the [[Reciprocal lattice]] of the crystal. In practice, the denominator of that rational number needs to be small, and the number needs to be independent of temperature.
