## $AV_6Sb_6$ DFT
- Both $AV_6Sb_6$ and $V_6Sb_4$ lack local magnetic interactions and possesses nonmagnetic ground states consistent with experiments. 
- In the presence of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the spin rotation symmetry is broken, subsequently, the nodal lines in a system with the coexistence of spatial inversion and [[Time reversal symmetry]] are always destroyed.
- Weak SOC effect.
- The gap opened at the Dirac band crossings is almost negligible (1MeV for $CsV_6Sb_6$). 
- Inclusion of Hubbard U in the DFT calculations does not change the band topology, and the Dirac nodal lines remain intact with U = 2.0 eV.

#### $CsV_6Sb_6$ Band structure 
![[CsV6Sb6_bands.png]]
- The DOS in the vicinity of [[Fermi level]] are dominated by V-3d orbitals for $CsV_6Sb_6$ and $V_6Sb_4$, whereas the Sb-p orbitals have weak contributions. 
- Shows linear band crossings that are close to [[Fermi level]] along the high symmetry points. 
- *The electronic structure of the bilayer compound is distinct from that of single layer [[AV3Sb5 family]] which are hallmarked by multiple Dirac crossings([[AV3Sb5 DFT]]) and saddle points near [[Fermi level]]*
- Due to the three-fold rotational symmetry, there are three equivalent middle planes, and thus six type-II Dirac nodal lines that are symmetrically distributed in the BZ of $CsV_6Sb_6$.
- Very weak SOC effect and hence Dirac nodal lines are intact. 

#### $V_6Sb_4$ Band structure 

![[V6Sb4_bands.png]]
-  The crossings of valence and conduction bands are absent along Γ/Z-L in the band structure of V6Sb4 (Fig. 2b). However, the preserved band crossings along Γ/Z-F can still form symmetry-protected nodal lines on three equivalent middle planes.
