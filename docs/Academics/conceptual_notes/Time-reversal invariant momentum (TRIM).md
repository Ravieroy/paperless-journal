# Time-Reversal Invariant Momenta
---
Time-Reversal Invariant Momenta are points at the Brillouin zone center and corners that obey: $-\mathbf{k} = \mathbf{k} \hspace{0.75cm} \text{mod} \hspace{0.25cm} \mathbf{G}$, where $G$ is a reciprocal lattice vector. There's $2^d$of them in d -dimensions. In 3D, they can be written as

$\Lambda_{n_1n_2n_3} = \frac{n_1}{2} \mathbf{b_1} + \frac{n_2}{2} \mathbf{b_2} + \frac{n_3}{2} \mathbf{b_3}$

Where $n_1n_2n_3 = 0,1$ and $b_i$ are the primitive reciprocal lattice vectors. Below are 2 figures showing these points in 2 and 3 dimensions for a square lattice. These lattices can be smoothly deformed into any other shape, so the definition of the TRIM does not change.
