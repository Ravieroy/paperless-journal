- The imaginary part of the optical conductivity of bilayer black phosphorus in units of $\sigma_0 = \pi e^2/2h$, showing a hyperbolic region (shaded) where $\text{Im}(\sigma_{xx}) \cdot \text{Im}(\sigma_{yy}) < 0$ starting at $\omega =2.8 eV$.
- $\text{Im}(\sigma_{xx})$ is negative throughout the spectrum (solid red line), $\text{Im}(\sigma_{yy})$ goes from negative to positive around (solid blue line) $\omega_h$= 2.8 eV, which results in a hyperbolic region starting at that frequency.

- Under compressive strain, ==the band gap of bilayer black phosphorus becomes smaller==. As a result, the optical peaks shift to lower frequencies and $\omega_h$ goes down. 
- For increasing bias in the bilayer case [Figs. 4(e) and 4(f)], the hyperbolic onset frequency $\omega_h$ first goes up, ==because the bands corresponding to the excitation causing the second peak move away from one another. Then it goes down as the band gap closes, and a new peak appears in between the two existing peaks, because breaking the mirror symmetry in the z direction allows for new hybrid transitions.==
