# Inverse photoemission spectroscopy
The technique of inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES) is the opposite of the much more common [[Photoelectron spectroscopy]] process.  ==It relies on incident low energy electrons interacting with a material's unoccupied orbitals in the conduction band.== As these electrons make the direct transition to fill the unoccupied states, the photons that are emitted are measured.  These photons are detected as a function of the kinetic energy (KE) of the incident electron beam.

^^==KEY POINTS==^^

- Reversed process 
- Electron hits the surface
- 3-step process 
	- coupling into unoccupied state (conduction)
	- decay through scattering 
	- photon emission
- Electron energies above the [[Fermi level]] are measured 
- Energy $\hbar \omega = E_i - E_f$
- Energy difference can be calculated with outgoing and incoming energy 
- Detection of energies between the Fermi and vacuum level is possible. 
- Angle resolved inverse photoemission can be used to obtain surface states.
