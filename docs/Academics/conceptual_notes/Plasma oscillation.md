# Plasma Oscillation
---
==If you had a neutral plasma (which can be the free charges in a metal) and you pulled the negative and positive charges apart and let them go, they would oscillate due to the electrostatic potential. This is an excitation known as a [plasma oscillation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_oscillation).==

 Plasma is a gas of charge particles. In metals, it is a neutral plasma, i.e., equal number of positive and negative charges are equal.

## Basic Calculation 
==Drude Model==
EM responses of metal are mostly governed by **"free electrons "**. Equation of motion:

$m\frac{d^2X}{dt^2} = -qE \rightarrow  -m\omega^2X = -qE$

Average dipole moment:

$P = -nqX = -\frac{nq^2}{mw^2} E$

where, n is the free electron number density. 

$\boxed{\epsilon = \left(1 -\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}\right)}, \text{where } \omega_p^2 = \frac{nq^2}{m\epsilon_0}$

$\omega_p :$ Plasma frequency. 

This tells us that the plasma frequency goes up with the free particle density. This is plasma oscillation. ==A plasmon is a single quantum of a plasma oscillation==. This is similar to a photon, which is a quantum of electromagnetic oscillation, where the exchange in energy is between electric and magnetic stored energies. 

> At lower frequencies, the damping is severe enough so that the electron kinetic energy no longer will play a role, so the response will be purely magnetic (caused by charge motion) and electric (caused by charge separation). At low enough frequencies, the mass of the charge carrier should play a role, as a heavier mass would result in reduced magnetic and electric response, due to reduced amplitude and speed of motion.

==Polaritons are also a quasiparticle that is produced when plasmons and em wave (photon) interacts/couples each other, usually strong interaction between them.==
