# Phase Transition
---
Phase transition is when a substance changes from a solid, liquid, or gas state to a different state. Every element and substance can transition from one phase to another at a specific combination of temperature and pressure.

Phase transition can be represented with a phase diagram. A phase diagram is a visual representation of how a substance changes phases.

## Basic Phase Diagram 
![[Phase_Diagram.png]]

These diagrams usually have the normal boiling point and normal melting point marked on them, and have the pressures on the y-axis and temperatures on the x-axis.

## What does this diagram show?
- **Critical Point:** At a temperature of 364 째C and a pressure of 218 atm, this is the point where there is **equilibrium between the liquid and gas phases**, any point above the critical point is a point where liquids cease to exist
- **Triple Point:** At a temperature of 0.01 째C and a pressure of 0.0060 atm, this is the point where **liquid, gas, and solids exist in equilibrium**
- **Freezing Point:** At a temperature of 0 째C and a pressure of 1.00 atm, this is the point at which water (liquid) freezes into ice (a solid)
- **Boiling Point:** At a temperature of 100.0 째C and a pressure of 1.00 atm, this is the point at which water (liquid) boils, turning it into a water vapor (gas)
