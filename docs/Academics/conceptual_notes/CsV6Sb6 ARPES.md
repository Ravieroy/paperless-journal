## $CsV_6Sb_6$ ARPES
![[CsV6Sb6_ARPES_Shi_etal.png]]

- At the [[Fermi level]], relatively high intensities are observed close to the boundary of the projected 2D BZ and hexagonal contour around the $\bar{\Gamma}$ point.  
- Hexagonal pocket around the $\bar{\Gamma}$ point and rounded triangular pocket centered at the $\bar{K}$ points at $E_b = 200 meV$
- Weak $k_z$ dependence of the bulk bands.
