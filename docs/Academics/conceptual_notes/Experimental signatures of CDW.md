# Experimental signatures of CDW
The phenomena of [[CDW]] ordering is usually confirmed experimentally using following experiments or observations.

## Transport
In a new material, the first suspicion of a CDW often comes from an anomaly (specifically, resistivity increasing with decreasing temperature in some temperature range) in the resistivity. This [[Behavior near CDW]] can be a hint to [[CDW]] which can then be well-founded by band structure calculations showing fermiology.  The following figure shows the anomalous behavior of normalized resistivity as a signature of [[CDW in NbSe3]]. [[Resistivity]] starts to increase below the CDW temperature because the transition depletes density of states on part of the Fermi surface, but eventually, metallic resistivity (decreasing with decreasing temperature) resumes because a portion of the Fermi surface stays metallic.

## X-ray or Electronic diffraction 
The 'proof' for CDW in a given material usually comes from diffraction experiments which show a superstructure--smaller Bragg peaks away from the nuclear Bragg peaks which appear at the CDW onset temperature. The presence of satellite reflections $\pm\vec{q}$ indicates that an additional periodicity of wavelength $2\pi/|\vec{q}|$ is superimposed upon the undistorted cell parallel to the $\vec{a}$ or $\vec{c}$ axes.

## Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
[[STM]] can detect a number of features related to the onset of CDW, including charge modulation, periodic distortion of atomic position, and the opening of a gap in the density of states.

## Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
[[ARPES]] can directly show which portions of the [[Fermi surface]] are gapped out by the [[CDW]]. This can give guidance whether the CDW is driven by [[Fermi surface nesting]] (q-vector connecting two parallel Fermi surface segments $T>T_{CDW}$ is the same as q-vector of satellite peaks in x-ray or electron diffraction) or by something more exotic.
