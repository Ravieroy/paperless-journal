# Degree of Freedom
---
!!! note "Defn. 1"
	The degree of freedom for a dynamic system is the number of directions in which a particle can move freely, or the total number of coordinates required to describe completely the position and configuration of the system. It is denoted by f or N.

!!! note "Defn. 2"
	The minimum number of independent coordinates needed to specify the position and configuration of a thermo-dynamical system in space is called the degree of freedom of the system.

## Examples
1. A free particle moving along x-axis needs only one coordinate to specify it completely. So its degree of freedom is one. Similarly, a particle moving over a plane has two degrees of freedom and a particle moving in space has three degrees of freedom.
2. A monoatomic molecule has only three translational degrees of freedom.
3. At Normal temperature, diatomic molecules have five degrees of freedom and at a very high temperature the diatomic molecules possess additional two degrees of freedom due to vibrational motion.
