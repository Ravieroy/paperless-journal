### Chiral Chemical Potential (CCP) 

Tags #chiral_magnetic_current #CME

Quantum anomalies in [[Weyl semimetal]] (for either $\textbf{E} \cdot \textbf{B} \ne 0$ or $\nabla T \cdot \textbf{B} \ne 0$) leads to chiral charge energy pumping between the opposite [[Chirality]] nodes. This results in chiral charge and energy imbalance between the Weyl nodes, which manifests in magneto-transport phenomena. 

Consider a [[Weyl semimetal]] with one pair of Weyl points of opposite [[Chirality]] (which act as [[Berry curvature]] monopoles), which are separated in the momentum space by $\delta \textbf{K}$ and in energy space by $\Delta$. This $\Delta$ is known as chiral chemical potential and is odd under ($\mathcal{P}$) operation. 

The nonconservation of chiral charge in the presence of electric field ($\textbf{E} \cdot \textbf{B} \ne 0$) is known as electrical [[Chiral Anomaly]].

Such a system breaks both the [[Time reversal symmetry]] ($\mathcal{T}$) and $\mathcal{P}$ symmetry.  This system possesses a dynamic magnetoelectric coupling $\theta(\textbf{x},t) \textbf{E} \cdot \textbf{B}$, where  $\theta(\textbf{x},t) = (\delta \textbf{K} \cdot \textbf{x} - \Delta T)$. 
Since $\delta \textbf{K}$ and $\Delta$ are respectively odd under [[Time reversal symmetry]] and inversion symmetry, this magnetoelectric coupling leads to the anomalous charge current.
$$j = \frac{e^2}{h} \delta \textbf{K} \times \textbf{E} + \frac{e^2}{h^2} \Delta B$$
In the absence of $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, the spatial gradient $\theta(\textbf{x},t)$ governs the anomalous charge Hall current. In contrast, the time derivative of $\theta(\textbf{x},t)$ induces a current along the direction of the applied MF for the inversion-asymmetric [[Weyl semimetal]], which is known as chiral magnetic current. 

Time dependent MF can create a response known as [[Dynamic chiral magnetic effect]].
