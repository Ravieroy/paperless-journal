1. $c_{n,\uparrow}^\dagger c_{n,\downarrow}$ 
	- Breaks [[Time reversal symmetry]] (TRS)
	- In-plane magnetization 
2. $c_{n,\uparrow}^\dagger c_{n+1,\downarrow}$ 
	- Doesn't necessarily have to break TRS or translational symmetry 
	- Spin-Orbit coupling 
3. $c_{n,\uparrow}^\dagger c_{n+1,\uparrow}^\dagger$
	- Doesn't conserve charge 
	- Unconventional Superconductivity (Crbr3/NbSe2)
