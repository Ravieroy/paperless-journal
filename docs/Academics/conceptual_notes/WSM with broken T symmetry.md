## Weyl semimetals with broken $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry
The simplest setting to discuss a [[Weyl semimetal]] is to assume broken [[Time reversal symmetry]], but to preserve inversion. This allows for the minimal number of Weyl nodes[[Weyl fermions]], i.e., two with opposite [[Chirality]]. Inversion symmetry guarantees they are at the same energy and furthermore provides a simple criterion to diagnose the existence of Weyl points based on the parity eigenvalues at the TRIM.

$H(\textbf{k}) = t_z(2-cosk_xa -cosk_ya+\gamma-cosk_za)\tau_z + t_x(sink_xa)\tau_x + t_y(sink_ya)\tau_y$

for  $-1 < \gamma <1$, we have a pair of Weyl nodes at location $(0,0,\pm k_0)$, where $cos k_0 =\gamma$
