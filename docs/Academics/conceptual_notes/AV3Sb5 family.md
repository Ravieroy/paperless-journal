## $AV_3Sb_5$ Family
The family of $AV_3Sb_5$(A=K, Rb, Cs) is a newly discovered series of kagome-based compounds realizing unconventional many-body phases and nontrivial electronic topology.

### Structure [^1]
![[KVS.png]]

- All materials exhibit a structurally perfect two-dimensional kagome net of vanadium. There are two distinct Sb sublattices.
-  The $AV_3Sb_5$ family crystallizes in the hexagonal P6/ mmm space group. The V-atoms create the kagome network, while the Sb1 atoms fill the centers with the kagome triangles. These V-Sb1 layers are sandwiched between graphite-like Sb2 layers that are, in turn, separated by the alkali-metal ions, creating easily exfoliable quasi-2D structures.
- This family of compounds possess both [[Time reversal symmetry]] and [[Inversion symmetry]].

### Structural Instabilities. 
- As discussed in [[AV3Sb5 general properties]]
