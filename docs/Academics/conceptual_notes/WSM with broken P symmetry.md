## Weyl semimetals with broken $\mathcal{P}$ symmetry
If $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved, then inversion symmetry must be broken to realize a [[Weyl semimetal]]. A key difference from the case of the [[WSM with broken T symmetry]] is that the total number of *==Weyl points must now be a multiple of four==*. This occurs since under time reversal, a Weyl node at $k_0$ is converted into a Weyl node at $−k_0$ with the same chirality. Since the *==net chirality must vanish==*, there must be another pair with the opposite chirality. 

> Such [[Inversion symmetry breaking]] [[Weyl semimetal]] may be more experimentally compatible as external fringe fields from a ferromagnet may be problematic
for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy’s (ARPES) momentum resolution. Additionally, without the complications of magnetism in principle some properties of the system should be simpler under strong magnetic field
