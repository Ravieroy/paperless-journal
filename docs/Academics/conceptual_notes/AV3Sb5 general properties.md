### Electronic Properties
#### Low temperature
 
![[AV3Sb5_Prop.png]]

1. Well-defined [[Meissner effect]] can be seen in fig. 2(e)
2. Sharp entropy anomaly at SC transition
3. Small critical field,$H_c = 0.4T$.
4. All AV3Sb5 compounds within the material family are superconducting at low temperature.
----

#### Above SC temperature
1. Normal states show quite different behavior. 
2. Typical metallic behavior modelled by $\rho(T)=\rho_0 +aT^2$.
3. Anomaly in temperature dependent electrical resistivity, and heat capacity (see fig.2(f, g)). 
4. Large anisotropy which agrees with V kagome layer playing a dominant role, confirming [[Quasi 2D Material]] nature.  

!!! important
	The kink behaviorin the $\rho(T)$ variation around 94K is related to long range [[CDW]] order. The sharp peak in heat capacity indicates the [[CDW]] transition is First order [[Phase transition]]

#### [[CDW]] 
1. CDW phase occurs for all the members of [[AV3Sb5 family]].
2. No long range order. (Neutron scattering measurements and Muon spin spectroscopy)
3. Transition derives from charge [[Degree of freedom]]. 
4. The transition is a CDW transition with $2 \times 2$ superlattice modulation.
5. Energy gap opening around the [[Fermi level]] of $\sim 50 meV$ which together with $2\times 2$ superlattice modulation disappears above $T_{CDW}$
6. Charge reversal across this gap. Hallmark of CDW ordering. 
7. ARPES measurements on [[KV3Sb5]] suggest the importance of structural transition.

####  [[Time reversal symmetry]]
  
1. Symmetry breaking signals was found in the [[CDW]] phases of $AV_3Sb_5$ compounds. 
2. There are six CDW ordering vectors $Q_{3Q}$ from the STM topographic spectrum.
3.  However, the intensity of these three pairs of vectors are different in the clean regions for all $AV_3Sb_5$ materials.
4. This defines the [[Chirality]] of the [[CDW]] order.(*direction from the lowest intensity peaks to the highest*)
5. This chirality shows an unusual response to the perturbation of the external MF.

`The highest vector peaks shift their positions under magnetic field applied along c-axis`

6. Onsager reciprocal relation, the response functions of a time-reversal preserving system under +B and -B must relate to each other by a time reversal operator. This non-reciprocal relation under magnetic field breaks the Onsager relation, indicating the [[Time reversal symmetry]] in this non-magnetic kagome system ([[Kagome metal]]).
7.  Emergence of local MF under $T_{CDF}$ due to [[Time reversal symmetry]].
8. Giant [[Anomalous Hall effect]] has also been observed in $AV_3Sb_5$ with onset concurrent with [[CDW]] order. (Usual causes are intrinsic [[Berry curvature]] and extrinsic impurity scattering)
9. Slightly unconventional [[Anomalous Hall effect]] is observed. 
10. It exhibits $\sigma_{AHE}(B\rightarrow 0) = 0$ without [[Hysteresis]] behavior.

#### [[Inversion symmetry]]
1. Inversion symmetry remains a valid symmetry for $AV_3Sb_5$ at all temperatures.
2. This constrains the [[CDW]] order and is important for superconducting pairing possibilities.
3. [[Nematicity]]

!!! important
	$AV_3Sb_5$ has structural [[Instability]] which can lead to two different types of configuration *Star of David* and *Tri-Hexagonal* as discussed in [[CsV3Sb5 DFT]]. Recent studies show that the average structure shows signatures of both TrH and SoD structures in staggered layer sequence.
