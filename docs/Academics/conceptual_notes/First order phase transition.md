# First order phase transition
---
## Basic Idea
When water starts boiling, it undergoes a phase transition from a liquid to a gas phase.
For both phases independently, the equation of state is a well-defined regular function, continuous, with continuous derivatives. However, while going from liquid to gas, one function “abruptly” changes to the other function. Such a transition is of first-order.
