## $AV_3Sb_5$ Band structure
---
- DFT calculations and ARPES measurements show multiple bands cross the Fermi level. 
-  The in-plane Sb $p_z$ orbital forms one electron pocket around the $\Gamma$ point, and the V d orbitals form multiple [[Fermi surface]] around the M points.
- It is very difficult to capture such a complicated Fermi surface topography in a simplified [[Tight-binding model]]. 
- The essential electronic structure of $AV_3Sb_5$ is widely believed to be dominated by the quasiparticles around the [[Van-Hove singularity]] points. 
	1. [[Van-Hove singularity]] points lies very close to [[Fermi level]] as obtained from [[DFT]] and [[ARPES]] calculations.
	2. Dominant scattering momenta are 3Q ($Qa, Qb,Q_c$) related to three M points as well as the $\Gamma$ point [[Fermi surface]] induced q1 scattering.
	3. Finally, the [[CDW]] gap size is maximum around the [[Van-Hove singularity]] points, while it vanishes at the $\Gamma$ pocket. 
	4. **A minimal model capturing the [[Van-Hove singularity]] points and $\Gamma$ point [[Fermi surface]] could faithfully describe the physics behind $AV_3Sb_5$.**
	5. A minimal 4 band model based on the V local $d_{X^2−Y^2}$ orbital and in-plane Sb $p_z$ orbital is proposed([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04703)).

*Prototypical tight-binding electronic structure of the kagome lattice. Dashed and solid lines are for the case with and without spin–orbit coupling, respectively. Two vHS at filling fractions n = 5/12 and n = 3/12 with diverging density of states are marked with grey shades in d. e, f, Fermi surface (FS) of the kagome lattice at the n = 5/12 filling with p-type vHS (e) and at the n = 3/12 filling with m-type vHS (f). Red, blue and green colours along the Fermi surface contour represent the distribution of three kagome sublattice weights. The nesting vector Q = (π, 0) and its symmetry equivalents are marked with black arrows. BZ, Brillouin zone.*

*Theoretical electronic structure of CsV3Sb5 from DFT. The solid arrows at K and H mark the multiple Dirac points (DP) emerging from the 3d orbital degrees of freedom in the V kagome net, while the dashed arrows mark the Dirac nodes emerging from the crossing between different kagome sets. Solid coral, blue and red lines indicate three saddle-like dispersions or vHS near the Fermi level and their $k_z$ dependence along the M–L line.*

## Orbital-projected electronic structure of $CsV_3Sb_5$

- In CsV3Sb5, four dispersive bands cross the Fermi level. The orbital projection from DFT reveals that the G band has dominant Sb character.
- The vanadium kagome net mainly contributes to the Fermi contours near the zone boundary $\bar{M}$ and $\bar{K}$
