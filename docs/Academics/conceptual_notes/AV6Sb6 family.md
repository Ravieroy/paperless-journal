## $AV_6Sb_6$ Family
The family of $AV_6Sb_6$(A=K, Rb, Cs) is a new class of bilayer kagome lattice compounds similar to [[AV3Sb5 family]] with Dirac nodal lines and other interesting properties. It shares [[AV3Sb5 general properties]], like Dirac nodal lines, [[Superconductivity]] under pressure.

#### Pressure-induced [[Superconductivity]]
 These do not exhibit [[Superconductivity]] at ambient pressure, although it is realized by applying quasi-hydrostatic pressure.

*Phase Diagram* (RRR : Residual Resistivity Ratio) 

- The T-dependence of the normalized resistance($R/R_{300K}$) show metallic behavior in the entire pressure range with RRR gradually decreases below 15GPa. 
- Superconducting transition emerges at 21.2 GPa manifested by Resistance drop.
- $T_c^{90\%}$ is 1.04K
- Evolution of $T_c$ : Non-monotonic 
- [[Superconductivity]] persists up to around 80 GPa. 
- Superconducting Dome is observed for all family members. 
- *Superconductivity in all the materials appears in the vicinity of RRR, implying that emergence of superconductivity is associated with electronic structure modifications.* 
- *Structural phase transition occurs above 20 GPa, where structure changes from rhombohedral to monoclinic.*
- It is likely that Monoclinic phase hosts the [[Superconductivity]].
