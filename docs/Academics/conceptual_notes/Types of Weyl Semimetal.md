# Weyl Semimetal : Types 
---
Topological [[Weyl semimetal]] (WSM) can be classified as type I in which [[Density of states]] vanishes at the Weyl nodes, and type II WSM, in which an electron pocket and a hole pocket meet at a singular point of momentum space.

==From a material science perspective, the type-I Weyl semimetal can be treated
as a direct negative band gap semiconductor while the type-II Weyl semimetal
features an indirect negative gap==

>*Fig. (a) shows the type-I Weyl nodes exist at the crossing points where the conduction band (red) and valence band (blue) dip into each other. A Fermi arc (green dotted line) connects the pair of Weyl nodes. Fig.(b) shows the [[Fermi surface]](FS) on the surface of the type-I semimetal. Fig. (c) is E-k dispersion of the type-II [[WSM with broken P symmetry]] **
>*Tilted type-II Weyl cones for at the intersection of the conduction and the valance bands. Fig. (d) shows the FS on the surface of type-II WSM. Projected bulk electron (red) and hole (blue) pockets coexist on the surface FS and touch at one discrete point, the type-II Weyl nodes.*

-  A loop (dashed blue line) to show a nonzero Chern number in (a) a type-I Weyl cone and (b) a type-II Weyl cone. 
- If the Weyl point lies above the [[Fermi level]] ($E_F$), then for the simplest case of type-I WSM, it is clear that we can show a nonzero Chern number by counting crossings of surface states on a closed loop, which lies entirely below the $E_F$.
- This however is not true for the type-II WSM. If we draw a loop below $E_F$ like before,it won't work because the loop runs into the bulk hole pocket. We can close the loop  by going to $E > E_w$, as in (e). However, then the loop must extend above $E_F$.
