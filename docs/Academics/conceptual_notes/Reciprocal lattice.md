# Reciprocal lattice 
---
A reciprocal lattice is regarded as a geometrical abstraction. It is essentially identical to a ==wave vector== k-space.

!!! note "Definition"
	- The collection of all wave vectors that yield plane waves with a period of the Bravais lattice. ==Note: any R vector is a possible period of the Bravais lattice.==
	- A collection of vectors $\vec{G}$ satisfying $e^{i\vec{G}\cdot \vec{R}} = 1$ or $\vec{G}\cdot\vec{R} = 2\pi n$, where n is an integer and is defined as: $k_1n_1 + k_2n_2 + k_3n_3$. Here $\vec{G}$ is a reciprocal lattice vector which can be defined as $k_1\vec{b_1} + k_2\vec{b_2} + k_3\vec{b_3}$, where $k_1$, $k_2$ and $k_3$ are integers. 
	- The reciprocal lattice vector $\vec{G}$ which generates the reciprocal lattice is constructed from the linear combination of the primitive vectors $\vec{b_1}$, $\vec{b_2}$ and $\vec{b_3}$, where $\vec{b_1} = 2\pi \frac{\vec{a_2} \times \vec{a_3}}{V_{\text{cell}}}$ and $\vec{b_2}$ and $\vec{b_3}$ can be obtained from cyclic permutation of 1, 2 and 3.


!!! question "Why do we need a reciprocal lattice?"
	Reciprocal lattice provides a simple geometrical basis for understanding:  
	1. All things of "wave nature" (like behavior of electron and  lattice vibrations in crystals.  
	2. The geometry of x-ray and electron diffraction patterns.
