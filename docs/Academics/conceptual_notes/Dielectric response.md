# Dielectric Response
Real and Imaginary permittivity, 

$\epsilon^* = \epsilon^\prime - i \epsilon^{\prime \prime}$

$\epsilon^\prime(\omega)  :$ Permittivity and $\epsilon^{\prime \prime}(\omega) :$ Dielectric loss. The conductivity is similarly represented as 

$\sigma^* = \sigma^\prime - i \sigma^{\prime \prime}$

*The real part of conductivity($\sigma^\prime$) is related to the imaginary part of dielectric response ($\epsilon^{\prime \prime}$)*
