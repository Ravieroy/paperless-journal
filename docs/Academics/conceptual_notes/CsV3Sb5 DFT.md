## DFT Calculations and Properties

![[CsV3Sb5_bands.png]]

1. Multiple bands crossing the Fermi level ($E_F$) in $CsV_3Sb_5$
2. Around the Î“ point, there is an electron-like parabolic band, which originates from the in-plane Sb $p_z$ orbital.
3. The bands around the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundaries are mainly attributed to the V d orbitals.
4. Two van Hove (VH) points close to $E_F$ around the M point, which play an important role in the symmetry breaking observed in $AV_3Sb_5$.
5. The upper VH point is further connected with the Dirac cone around the K point, which reflects a typical feature of the kagome model. 

## ARPES

 ARPES and DFT data tracing reveal multiple Dirac points throughout the dispersion. 

## Phonon Calculation

`Phonon spectrum`

- There are two negative energy soft modes around the M and L points respectively, leading to structural instabilities 
- *Star of David(SoD)* and *Tri-Hexgonal(TrH)* are likely candidates for [[CDW]] structures.

***Tri-Hexagonal(TrH) is also known as Inverse Star of David.***
