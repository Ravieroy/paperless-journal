## $KV_3Sb_5$
---

Similar to [[CsV3Sb5]], $KV_3Sb_5$ is also from the [[AV3Sb5 family]] which is a [[Kagome metal]] and shares lots of common [[AV3Sb5 general properties]]. 

- Transition temperature, $T_c$ = 0.93K
- [[Fermi surface]] in KV3Sb5 exhibit diverse CDW gap structures. 
- The CDW gap vanishes for the α FS around the BZ Γ point. Since the $\alpha$ FS stems from the $p_z$ band of the in-plane Sb, the $p_z$ orbital does not participate in the [[CDW]] formation.

- V-derived [[Fermi surface]] around the BZ boundary exhibit highly momentum-dependent CDW gaps. 
- These are dominated by quasiparticles around the van Hove singularities at the M points.
- V kagome layer dominates the CDW gaps, and the VH quasiparticles deeply influence the gap structure in $AV_3Sb_5$.

*ARPES measured band structures (right) and their second derivatives. There are two additional CDW gaps at $MG_2$(150meV) and $MG_3$(125meV) away from $E_F$ at 20K.*

!!! important
	This feature strongly indicates that the structural transition plays an important role in this CDW transition. It is also clear that the structural transition mostly affects the V kagome network, while the out-of-plane coupling involving Sb pz orbitals is hardly changed.
