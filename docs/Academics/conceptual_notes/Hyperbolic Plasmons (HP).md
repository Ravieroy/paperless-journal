## Hyperbolic Plasmon
Conductivity Tensor 
$$\begin{pmatrix}
  \sigma_{xx} & \sigma_{xy}\\ 
  \sigma_{yx} & \sigma_{yy}
\end{pmatrix}$$
We note that the real part of dielectric permittivity is proportional to the $\text{Im}(\sigma)$, a consequence of current continuity, then, a hyperbolic region appears when,
$$\sigma_{xx} \ne \sigma_{yy}, \text{ }\text{Im}(\sigma_{xx}) \cdot \text{Im}(\sigma_{yy}) < 0$$ Only one component of the conductivity tensor is of metallic type. On the other hand, Re(σ), is directly proportional to the optical absorption of the freestanding 2D layer. 

The in-plane anisotropy provides the potential to realize [[HP in Black Phosphorus]] within the plane of a 2D material. The structural anisotropy in all van der Waals crystals results in a strong optical birefringence. Hyperbolicity is defined as an extreme type of birefringence, whereby the permittivity along orthogonal crystal axes are not just different, but opposite in sign[^1]

The natural optical anisotropy associated with van der Waals crystals, and the polar nature of many, should in principle offer a broad range of naturally occurring hyperbolic materials covering a very broad spectral range. Strong anisotropy in electron motion along the in-plane (metallic) and out-of-plane (insulating) layered materials can lead to hyperbolicity for specific frequency bands (graphite and magnesium diboride).
