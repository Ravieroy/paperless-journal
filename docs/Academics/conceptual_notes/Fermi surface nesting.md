# Fermi Surface Nesting
Fermi surface nesting means that there are two parallel pieces of a Fermi surface, such that a single q-vector can connect many points. A one dimensional metal automatically has perfect nesting because the Fermi surface consists of two points at  $k= \pm k_F$.

For higher dimensions, the [[Fermi surface]] is circular or spherical for free-electron like single-band medal and hence nesting will not be perfect but systems with strong interaction (or quasi 1D bands) can have Fermi surface nesting.

**Not all [[CDW]] are driven by nesting, and not all [[Fermi surface]] topologies with a good nesting condition result in [[CDW]] instability**
