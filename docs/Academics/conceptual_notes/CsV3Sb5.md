## $CsV_3Sb_5$

$CsV_3Sb_5$ is from the [[AV3Sb5 family]] which is a [[Kagome metal]] and shares lots of common [[AV3Sb5 general properties]]. 

### Electronic Properties

![[CsV3Sb5_Prop.png]]

- Onset of [[Superconductivity]] for $CsV_3Sb_5$ with $T_c = 2.3K$, continuously suppressed by MF. 
- The kink behavior in the $\rho(T)$ variation ([[AV3Sb5 general properties]]) around 94K is related to long range [[CDW]] order. The sharp peak in heat capacity indicates the [[CDW]] transition is [[First order phase transition]] [[phase transition]]
- This weakly first order transition is best characterized in $CsV_3Sb_5$

## Topological Properties
- The normal state of $CsV_3Sb_5$ is a $Z_2$ topological metal, and this $Z_2$ topological property leads to a surface state embedding around the bulk FS at the M point
