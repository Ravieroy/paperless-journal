# A Strong Coupling Approach to Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
*Arghya Tarapher*
1. Analysis of recent experiments on TMDs that contradict the traditional picture of [[CDW]] originating from [[Fermi surface nesting]] using strong coupling approach[^1].
2. Focus on $TiSe_2$ and $TaSe_2$.
3. A strong-coupling view of the CDW arising as a Bose condensation of preformed excitons emerges as a possibility[^2]. 
4. Explanation of normal state data of these systems. 
5. The incoherent normal state arises out of the coupling between putative quasiparticles and soft excitonic fluctuations.
6. The broken symmetry states at low temperatures, the unconventional superconductivity (USC) and [[CDW]] are instabilities of such a strongly correlated excitonic liquid with reduced single-particle coherence.
7. Effect of disorder[^3]? *Tips the balance between the broken symmetry states, favoring one over the other.*
