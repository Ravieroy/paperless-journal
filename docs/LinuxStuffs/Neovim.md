### Neovim 

Neovim is a fork of [[Vim]] that improves the extensibility and maintainability of Vim. It is not a fundamentally different editor, rather it was the next step along the editor history. It is an enhanced out-of-the-box version of the Vim text editor, or you can say, it is a more simplified Vim which makes integrations much easier than with Vim. 

Users who are just getting started, the [[Difference between Vim and Neovim]] is not that apparent and are basically identical. 

### Installation 
 `neovim` needs to be manually installed using respective [[Package manager]] of the distro. For Ubuntu/Debian based distros, 
```bash
sudo apt install neovim
```
### Usage 
The usage for `neovim` is same as [[Vim]]. In order to edit a file in `neovim` open a [[Terminal]] and type
```bash
nvim fileName
```

***All the similar commands from [[vim]] is used in `neovim` as well. To make things familiar to `vi` or `vim` one can [[Set an alias]] for `neovim` to something like `vim` or `vi`***
