# Font spacing bug in Konsole
---
!!! bug
## Issue
The font spacing is weird in Konsole which affects the [[Terminal]] in Dolphin as well. The bug is easily noticeable as it sticks out like a sore thumb. Some symptoms are like
- The cursor moves far righter than it is supposed to be,
- Texts go out of alignment 

!!! attention
It is known bug and the quick fix is to change to certain fonts which are unaffected with this bug, like **Andale Mono, Courier, Courier New, DejaVu Sans Mono**

Open konsole and then ***Settings  -> Edit current profile -> Appearance***. Change the font to *DejaVu Sans Mono*.
