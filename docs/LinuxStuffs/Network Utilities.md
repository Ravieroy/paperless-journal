## Network configuration methods 
- [[nmcli]] : Short for network manager command line interface. This tool is useful when access to a graphical environment is not available and can also be used within scripts to make network configuration changes.
- `nmtui` : Short for network manager text user interface. This tool can be run within any terminal window and allows changes to be made by making menu selections and entering data.
- `nm-connection-editor` : A full graphical management tool providing access to most of the Network Manager configuration options. It can only be accessed through desktop or console. 
- `systemsettings` : This could be like GNOME settings(`gnome-control-center`) or KDE settings(`systemsettings`) in the desktop environment.
