## Zsh Installation 
`zsh` is a shell similar to `bash`. While the functionality can be similar in several [[Terminal]] shells, zsh offers some nice plugins and features which is useful in general. See [[oh-my-zsh installation]] to get the best out of zsh. 

It is available in all the major distro package manager and can be installed from there. For Ubuntu or its derivative, simply use,

```bash
sudo apt install zsh
```

Inorder to make `zsh` a default shell use the following command in [[Terminal]]

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
