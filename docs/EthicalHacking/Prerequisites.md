## The Lab

### Virtualization 
- Install a number of operating systems inside the current OS
- Each machine has its own resources and functions like a real machine 
	- Makes testing easier 
	- Easier to fix 
	- Isolated from the host OS 

### Kali Linux
- Linux distribution based on Debian 
- made for hackers 
- contains most of the tools required
- can be installed as VM(virtual machine) or as a main machine.

### Enabling Virtualization 
- Feature required to run virtual machines 
- Enabled by default on Apple computers 
- Might need to be enabled from [[BIOS]] in some computers.
- General Process
	1. Reboot your computer
	2. Enter [[BIOS]] settings 
	3. Enable virtualization; the setting may be called 
		- VT-x
