Electrons in solids can absorb incident photons with energy larger than the work function of the host material, typically a few electronvolts, and escape into the vacuum. These photoemitted electrons, also known as photoelectrons, are collected by an electron analyzer that measures their kinetic energy and momentum. From these measurements, the original band structure is extracted.</p> <p>The electronic band structures directly visualized by ARPES can provide straightforward evidence of the topological characteristics of topological quantum materials(TQMs). The fact that ARPES is sensitive to both bulk and surface electrons makes it possible to obtain a comprehensive understanding of complex bulk and surface electronic structures, such as topological surface states in topological insulators, Dirac and Weyl fermions in bulk states, and the associated surface Fermi arcs.</p> <p>As an ARPES measurement under one photon energy probes the band dispersion along a 2D surface in the 3D momentum space, light sources with tunable photon energy (e.g., a synchrotron radiation light source) are needed to obtain the band structure covering the whole 3D BZ. Scanning the photon energy, the probed 2D surface in the momentum space sweeps through the entire 3D BZ; thus, characteristic electronic features of TQMs in the bulk phase, including the Dirac points and Weyl points that reside at certain momenta in the 3D BZ, can be located and observed.</p> <p>In addition to measuring the electronic states as a function of momentum and energy, I(k, E), thanks to developments in the past couple of decades, ARPES can also explore other degrees of freedom of electrons, including their spin polarization, spatial distribution, and time evolution.

The CDW-induced band splitting and the associated gap opening have been revealed at the boundary of the pristine and reconstructed Brillouin zones. The Fermi surface- and momentum-dependent CDW gap is measured and the strongly anisotropic CDW gap is observed for all the V-derived Fermi surface. In particular, we have observed signatures of the electron-phonon coupling in \\(KV_3Sb_5\\).

It is often used interchangeably with Fermi level, although both the terms are equal at absolute zero temperature, they are different at other temperatures.</p> <p>If you consider a typical metal the highest energy band (i.e. the conduction band) is partially filled. The conduction band is effectively continuous, so thermal energy can excite electrons within this band leaving holes lower in the band. At absolute zero there is no thermal energy, so electrons fill the band starting from the bottom and there is a sharp cutoff at the highest occupied energy level. This energy defines the Fermi energy. At finite temperatures there is no sharply defined most energetic electron because thermal energy is continuously exciting electrons within the band. The best you can do is define the energy level with a 50% probability of occupation, and this is the Fermi level.</p> <p>The reason for the existence of this energy level is due to Pauli exclusion principle, which states two fermions cannot occupy that same quantum state. So, if a system has more than one fermion, each fermion has a different set of magnetic quantum numbers associated with it. The Fermi Temperature(\\(T_F\\)) can be defined as the energy of the Fermi level divided by the Boltzmann\u2019s constant.

The Fermi level of a metal at zero temperature is the same as the Fermi energy of that metal. This is not true for insulators, where the Fermi level lies inside the energy gap. If we refer to the Fermi energy as the Fermi level at zero temperature. With this definition, the Fermi energy does not need to coincide with an actual energy level of the system.(See Useful Links)</p> <p>It determines the probability of electron occupancy at different energy levels. The closer the Fermi level is to the conduction band energy, the easier it will be for electrons in the valence band to transition into the conduction band.

The section on <code>palette</code> can also be configured to change the look of the website. You can change the colors for light/dark mode here by changing the <code>primary</code> and <code>accent</code> subsections.  The features of Markdown like highlighting using (=), underlining using a caret(^) is set up in <code>markdown_extensions</code> section.
